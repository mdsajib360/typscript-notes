# interface 
- ##### In TypeScript, an interface is a way to define the shape or structure of an object. It specifies the properties and methods that an object should have without providing any implementation. While it has some similarities to a class in JavaScript, it serves a different purpose.

### Key Features of Interfaces in TypeScript:

1. **Defining Object Structure**:
   Interfaces describe the expected structure of an object:

   ```typescript
   interface User {
       name: string;
       age: number;
       greet(): string;
   }

   const user: User = {
       name: "Alice",
       age: 25,
       greet: () => "Hello!",
   };
   ```

2. **No Implementation**:
   Interfaces do not contain implementation details. They only describe what properties and methods an object should have.

3. **Optional Properties**:
   Use the `?` symbol to make properties optional:

   ```typescript
   interface User {
       name: string;
       age?: number; // Optional
   }

   const user: User = { name: "Bob" };
   ```

4. **Readonly Properties**:
   Use `readonly` to make properties immutable after initialization:

   ```typescript
   interface User {
       readonly id: number;
       name: string;
   }

   const user: User = { id: 1, name: "Charlie" };
   // user.id = 2; // Error: Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property.
   ```

5. **Extending Interfaces**:
   Interfaces can extend other interfaces to combine or enhance their structure:

   ```typescript
   interface Person {
       name: string;
   }

   interface Employee extends Person {
       employeeId: number;
   }

   const employee: Employee = { name: "Dana", employeeId: 123 };
   ```

6. **Implementing Interfaces in Classes**:
   A class can implement an interface to ensure it adheres to a specific structure:

   ```typescript
   interface Shape {
       area(): number;
   }

   class Circle implements Shape {
       constructor(private radius: number) {}

       area(): number {
           return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
       }
   }
   ```

### Differences Between **Interface** and **Class**:

| **Feature**           | **Interface**                                           | **Class**                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**           | Defines a contract for objects.                         | Blueprint for creating objects with data and behavior.                         |
| **Implementation**    | No implementation; only defines structure.              | Can have implementation details (methods and properties).                      |
| **Inheritance**       | Supports multiple inheritance via `extends`.            | Only supports single inheritance, though it can implement multiple interfaces. |
| **Runtime Existence** | Exists only at compile time; no runtime representation. | Exists at runtime.                                                             |
| **Instantiable**      | Cannot create an instance.                              | Can create an instance using `new`.                                            |

### Is It Similar to Classes in JavaScript?

Not directly. Interfaces in TypeScript are closer to "contracts" or "protocols" rather than actual objects or blueprints like JavaScript classes. They exist only at compile time to help TypeScript enforce type checking. Classes, on the other hand, are used to create objects and include both structure and behavior at runtime.
